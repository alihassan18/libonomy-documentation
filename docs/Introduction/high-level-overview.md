# Overview

## What is Libonomy ?

Libonomy is a next-gen blockchain, one that presents a realistic solution for mass adoption – autonomous, completely decentralized, secure, and can provide high scalability and efficiency in a real-world environment.

Libonomy is built so that the people today and the generations to come can utilize the best that the blockchain technology has to offer in an environment that is as simple as any mobile or desktop application, has no limitations, and can continuously adapt to fulfill all the ever-changing technology requirements.

It is all possible with the introduction of Libonomy’s artificial intelligence-governed engine and reinvented blockchain’s architecture, which helps to eliminate all the major issues of decentralized technology that are present in all of the former blockchains – low speed, poor efficiency, many security concerns, lack of usability, insufficient scalability, poor connectivity and inflexibility.

This technology is meant for enterprises as much as it’s meant for general society – it provides a strong, robust and versatile network that can be utilized by anyone. Tools like decentralized multi-currency wallet, one-click applications, file storage, multilingual development kit and many others will help to gain more and more awareness. On top of that, Libonomy is the first to present a decentralized interoperability solution, in other words: connections between different technologies will be one of the most demanding factors in 2021 and years to come.

### Eco-system For Developers

Libonomy is an AI driven autonomous blockchain with all-around improved performance. It’s **scalable**, **autonomous** and **layer-1 interoperable**. It connects other blockchain together and is the first universal solution that can be used to create any private, public or hybrid blockchain project. Libonomy simplifies development experience with easy-to-use blockchain development tools for developers, and provides a variety of services for developers to realize their maximum potential.

- Application Layer Support
- Interoperable DEX
- Cross-chain support
- Decentralized AI
- Fair Resource Distribution
- Dynamic Block Size

## What is Libonomy SDK?

The Libonomy-SDK gives developers the ability to carry out the development of decentralized applications on top of the blockchain at application level instead of interacting with the blockchain core. SDK provides the ability to create your own blockchains on top of libonomy or interact with other blockchains built on aphelion or other consenssus. SDK also gives the ability to write your own machine learning algorithms and run them directly on aphelion prtocol or libonomy network.

### Features

The Libonomy SDK is the most advanced framework for building custom application-specific blockchains today. Here are a few reasons why you might want to consider building your decentralised application with the Libonomy SDK:

- EVM And WEB3 Compatibility
- POS,POW, DPOS, BFT Consensus Support
- Decentralized AI Support
- Hybrid Consensus Interaction Channel
- Custom Blockchain
- Cross-Chain Integration
- Extend REST Interface
- Golang SDK
- Decentralized Application (dApps) Development
- Application Level Blockchain Development Support
- Multi-Language Support

### Getting started with SDK

- Learn more about the aphelion protocol
- Learn how to build your own blockchain
- Learn how to run hybrid chains
- Learn how to interact with hybrid consensus
