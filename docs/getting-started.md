# Getting Started

<!-- Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**. -->
This document will guide you on setting up the libonomy node and connecting it
over to the current mainnet-stake release.



**Important:** Due the release of new features of mainnet such as P2P AI Protocol,
Inter Neural Smart contract VM or INSC VM , BTC, ETH and COSMOS relay, the
chain of the mainnet will chain to further versions. The development team of libonomy will provide the version of mainnet chain
before the the upgrade occurs.

Kindly don't try to run validator nodes without developers consultation , the validator nodes
include the AI model configuration which stands out of the scope of this documentation and
integration, as AI model is meant for core configurations not for normal community usage.

**For the sake of simplicity, we haven't explained the overall working of the consensus system that
is staking , AI and Neural Consensus . Refer to Whitepaper for general understanding**
